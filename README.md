# Data Science Programming
The Different notebooks cover multiple areas of machine learning, I've discussed a variety of fundamental and advanced machine learning and deep learning topics. beginning with Python basics and progressed to several machine learning techniques such as decision trees and ensemble approaches. After that, I looked into text mining, neural networks, and deep learning ideas like convolutional neural networks and autoencoders. It's worth mentioning that recurrent neural networks, which operate well with sequential data, were also covered. Finally, the course concluded with a final lecture that most likely highlighted the main lessons from each topic addressed. Overall, I have received a solid foundation in both machine learning and deep learning, which will help me tackle a wide range of real-world challenges.
