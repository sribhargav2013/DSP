Now, from our sample population of smokers, we see that about 50% of them die of cancer. If smokers make up 10% of the population, then we can expect that 5% of the population will die of cancer. If we apply this model to the entire population (some random individual), the cost of a missed diagnosis is 10,000,000*5% = 500,000.\n",

In such cases, we need to know which score is more effective for our given context. In the above screnerio, if we give a person the test and they don't have cancer, it costs $1,000. If we don't give this person a test but they have cancer, we avoided the $1000 spent, but the cost of the life was 10,000,0000. In this particular case, we use a null model that is assume everyone has cancer and give them the test. \n",
